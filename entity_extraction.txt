-Goal-
Given a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.

-Steps-
1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized
- entity_type: One of the following types: [{entity_types}]
- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities
Format each entity as ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>

2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other
- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity
 Format each relationship as ("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)

3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.

4. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}

-Additional Instructions for Hardware Design Specifications-
For each identified entity and relationship, ensure they align with the context of hardware design specifications. This includes detailed descriptions and connections that reflect the intricacies of hardware components, protocols, and configurations.

Entity Types:
["Design Specification", "Section", "Subsection", "Table", "Figure", "Author", "Module", "Submodule", "Protocol", "Signal", "Port", "Register", "FIFO", "Clock", "Interrupt", "Operation", "Frequency", "Standard", "Reference", "Component", "Version", "Date", "Comment", "Pin", "Configuration", "Constraint/Rule", "Address", "Document", "Block"]

Text:
while Alex clenched his jaw, the buzz of frustration dull against the backdrop of Taylor's authoritarian certainty. It was this competitive undercurrent that kept him alert, the sense that his and Jordan's shared commitment to discovery was an unspoken rebellion against Cruz's narrowing vision of control and order.

Then Taylor did something unexpected. They paused beside Jordan and, for a moment, observed the device with something akin to reverence. “If this tech can be understood..." Taylor said, their voice quieter, "It could change the game for us. For all of us.”

The underlying dismissal earlier seemed to falter, replaced by a glimpse of reluctant respect for the gravity of what lay in their hands. Jordan looked up, and for a fleeting heartbeat, their eyes locked with Taylor's, a wordless clash of wills softening into an uneasy truce.

It was a small transformation, barely perceptible, but one that Alex noted with an inward nod. They had all been brought here by different paths

1 Introduction
1.1 Description
I2C is a multimaster protocol used to simplify use from uart and defined by philips like a standart module to interface with analogic devices. Here is presented a solution using a interface with APB protocol definided by the ARM. I2C in general transport 8 bit data through bidirectional ports SDA and use clock SCL to give a pulse and control transport data. But This I2C has propurse is to transport 16 bit data. Figure 1 show a Top block using APB and I2C and Table 1 show the pinout description used for each block.

I2C Top Block operation

3.0.4 CLOCK RANGE WORK

Initially this module should work with frequencies from 100 kHz to 5 MHz But this should be verified in FPGA if it can work in the desired frequencies.

4 Final considerations

The I2C module is still in development and has yet to be verified their functionality. This document need still show the waveforms and a detailed explanation of the waveforms of the transmission and reception of I2C.

Text:
The design specification for the new hardware module includes a detailed section on the communication protocols. This section describes the signal types and their corresponding ports. The module uses a standard FIFO for data transmission and operates at a frequency of 100 MHz. The design complies with the IEEE 802.3 standard and references the latest version of the hardware manual.

The module has several submodules, each with specific configurations. Submodule A handles data processing and is configured to generate interrupts when data is ready. Submodule B manages the clock signal and ensures synchronization with other components. The module also includes a table listing all the registers and their addresses.

The design specification is authored by John Doe and includes comments for future revisions. The document is dated January 1, 2023, and is part of the project's documentation repository.
